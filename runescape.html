We've recently had a few queries from RuneScape users who say the RuneScape Windows client
is crashing. (Even though it worked fine previously). We haven't changed our windows client
recently, and from what we've been told it seems it's actually a recent windows update which
is causing this problem.
<p>
We believe this problem has now been fixed in another windows update. Therefore if you
are having problems with the RuneScape client failing we recommend you
visit <a href="http://www.windowsupdate.com">windowsupdate.com</a> to get the latest
patches. This should fix it.

<center><b>Fatigue reduced - 25th November 2002</b></center><p>
Due to popular demand, it is now possible to mine and fish for longer without getting tired!
<p>
There are now two sort of rocks you can mine:
<p>
Soft rocks - These rocks spawn quite slowly, but they are easy to mine so you get very
little fatigue from them. Mining these rocks is much like mining was originally before
we changed it. You can easily get a full load of ore before you become too tired to mine. 
<p>
Hard rocks - These use our new mining system for less repeat clicking. You can get the ore
out of the rocks very quickly, and you can see it spawn so you aren't clicking blindly. However
you will need to rest quite often when mining these rocks. For people who don't like clicking
the same spot on the screen over and over you may find this way more fun.
<p>
We've also adjusted the fishing system. We considered introducing deep and shallow fish, but
it doesn't work too well so instead we've just made the fish give a lot less fatigue than before,
and spawn close to the original rate. This was what most players indicated they wanted.
<p>
One final note: We are aware that the numbers of soft and hard rocks may need balancing slightly.
We will be keeping a close eye on this to make sure there are enough rocks of each type available.
Depending on which rock type is most popular we may need to adjust the numbers slightly, so there is
no need to ask us about this.

<center><b>Small tweaks to mining - 15th November 2002</b></center><p>
Today we've made the following small changes to mining:
<p>
<li>You can now mine twice as much silver before getting tired. This is because
it was pointed out that it shouldn't really by harder to get silver than gold.
This actually now means silver is easier to get than it has ever been in the past
<p>
<li>We've made it 2-3 times easier to get gems under the new mining system, since
that wasn't quite balanced correctly
<p>
<li>We've added a new mine in the swamp south of Lumbridge with 4 mithril rocks, and
1 adamantite rock, this is to replace the rocks removed from elsewhere.
The rocks were moved to make sure everything is the correct distance from a bed for
the new system to work properly.
<p>
<li>We made bread, pies, and pizza restore TWICE as much fatigue as they did before,
which should make these foods much more worthwhile. We predict enterprising pizza
sellers will turn up at the mining sites shortly :-)
<p>
A few confused players seem to think the new fatigue system actually makes mining
take longer, but this is not the case. After testing every single mining site at
every single level, we can conclusivly say that it takes no longer to get ore,
or level-up than before. But it's a heck of a lot less tedious and repetitive.
<p>
Remember we've added lots of new beds so you might not have to walk as far as you
think, we're hoping to add all bed locations to our worldmap soon to help you find
them.

<center><b>Fatigue - version #2 now online - 14th November 2002</b></center><p>
We've worked extremely hard today to update the mining/fishing system with respect to your
comments and feedback. The old system was considered rather too much of a change by many,
so we've made a new one is more like the original mining. Here is how the new system works.
<p>
<li>You can now actually see ore in the rock on the screen, so you can see when it spawns
<li>Ore now appears in the rocks TWICE as fast as it did pre-fatigue
<li>When ore is available you will always manage to get it now, you very very rarely miss
<li>To compensate for the faster spawns you get slightly tired as you mine
<li>The higher level you have, the more you can mine before you become tired
<p>
We've put a LOT of effort into balancing this system, I even wrote a little test program
to compare the overall times of mining and fishing before and after, (this takes into
account the extra time taken to go and get some rest), the time it takes to get ore / level
should new be pretty much EXACTLY the same it was before, but mining is now much more varied
and fun. We've also moved an awful lots of bed, and a few rocks/fish to make certain all
the sites always have a bed within a carefully calculated distance, 
<p>
Please give the system a good chance before sending any feedback. We've really put a lot
of effort into making sure the version#2 system doesn't disadvantage anyone (except cheats!)
<p>
We might need to make a few more tweaks yet, but hopefully we're getting close to a
really good system now.
<p>
Thanks Andrew

<center><b>Latest RuneScape News - 13th November 2002</b></center><p>
Mining improved! We have changed mining and fishing so that they no longer
consist of hours of tedious repetative clicking. The rocks are now easier to mine
so you don't have to click anything like as much, and prospecting always works.
<p>
Instead of the repetative clicking we have introduced a new 'fatigue' system which means
as you do tasks such as mining your character slowly becomes tired. After a certain point
(which depends on your level, and on the rock), you will become too tired to mine.
When this happens simply rest at a bed or eat some food, and you'll feel much more lively
again. The upshot of this is that the honest miners should be able to get their ore
slightly quicker, whilst the cheats will just have to go somewhere else.
<p>
Also due to popular request we have modified the wilderness monsters so they are always
agressive regardless of your level. It was pointed out by many players that the wilderness is
supposed to be dangerous place, so the new monster attacking rule has been removed in this
zone.

The mother of all updates has just landed! 
<p>
<b>New Quests:</b>
<p>
Biohazard (Members' Quest) This is the second part of our 
large ongoing quest. Elena has been rescued, but now she needs 
your help to find a cure for the plague - so the fate of hundreds 
could rest in your hands! Find out if you're a thinker or a do-er
... because you'll need to be both.
<p>
Jungle Potion (Members' Quest) Trufitus Shakaya of the Taie Bwo 
Wannai Village requires that you collect five special jungle 
herbs for a potion so he can commune with his Gods. The jungle 
area has been greatly expanded for this quest.
<p>
<b>New members town - The town of Yanille:</b>
<p>
Explore this border town in the far south of Kandarin. 
Experienced Wizards will want to make use of the Wizards' Guild 
(magic level 66 to enter). Yanille also contains, a bank, a cookery
shop, an inn and various other features.
<p>
<b>New members spells - Enfeeble, stun, vulnerability:</b>
<p>
You can now use more powerful high level versions of the the weaken,
confuse and curse spells. They are cast using the new "soul rune", 
bought from the wizards' guild.
<p>
<b>New features:</b>
<p>
Dragon bones - Do you feel like you're praying in vain? Dragon 
bones can now be buried for a bigger prayer xp bonus than 
big bones.
<p>
Improved monster A.I. Monsters who are far weaker than you no longer 
auto attack. We thought it a bit strange that weak monsters were 
so stupid as to regularly commit suicide on a far stronger opponent, 
so they won't anymore. This also helps stop cheats who use programs 
to unfairly keep their character logged in at a respawn point, and 
gain combat xp unfairly.

their adventures on tutorial island, where the good people of Runescape are busy

and pick up some handy culinary tips.
<p> 
Waterfall Quest (Members quest) - Walk along the river that flows through Kandarin, where
the locals speak of hidden treasure, and the legend of the Elven King. Search for a
place untouched by human hand, and for treasures whose value cannot be counted.
<p> 
King Black Dragon (Members monster) - The most fearsome monster ever to venture into Runescape
has now... err... ventured into Runescape. So for all you plucky young upstarts, take
a break from emailing customer support and pit your wits against the deadliest beast
to date! More prudent types might just want to gaze at him from afar. Of course you'll

RuneScape progress update.
<p>
It's been a while since I last revealed what we're currently working on, so here goes! 
<p>
Lots of people said it would be really great if RuneScape had more of an overall story-line and if there was some sort of ongoing plot. Therefore we're pleased to say that we've designed a massive twisting plot which we're going to release over multiple episodes. The next update (hopefully tuesday or wednesday), will contain a new quest which is epsiode #1 of this story. We've also been working on a 'RuneScape history' page, which gives some background story for the RuneScape world, which we hope to put online soon. 
<p>
Whilst the rest of the dev-team have been focussing on that, myself and Tony have been working very hard on the promised new 3d-graphics system. This is a mammoth task since we are replacing a vast chunk of the graphics and code. The new engine is coming together extremely well, although there's still a lot of work to do. I hope to get another preview online with the next couple of weeks so you can see how we are doing. We're now nearly ready to show a preview demo of our new landscape engine, our new character animation system, and our new improved user interface. 
<p>
As I mentioned before this new graphics engine will also allow us much more flexible maps, and so we will finally be able to put the player owned houses and carpentry in. However since that update is still quite a long way off, the rest of the dev-team is going to work on a new 'agility' skill next. This will give the members something else new to enjoy meanwhile whilst we finish off our big graphics update. 
<p>
Note: A few people have been tricked by fake previews of our upcoming updates. Any previews we put online will always be on this website only, and will not require your RuneScape password to view. NEVER enter your password anywhere but runescape.com or it will be stolen!

We've just got another 2 members quests online. Sorry it took a bit longer than expected.
We've been trying a new testing method to make sure there are less bugs than the last update.
<p>
The 1st quest is the hazeel cult quest. Thieves have stolen the carnillean family armour, and
you are asked to recover it. This quest is a bit different because there are two very different
ways of completing it! Will you side with the Hazeel Cult or with Ceril Carnillean?
<p>
The 2nd quest is the sheep herder quest in which you must safely herd four plagued sheep away
from the city of Ardougne before the citizens become infected! Speak to Councillor Halgrive to
start this quest.

The hiscore tables are back online, and we've increased them to show the top 100,000 players!!
We've also added a search facility so you can quickly find your name and see where you rank
<p>
An unrelated warning to free edition users - we've discovered that the members 'gnome amulet' is
accidently usable on the free server. However we will obviously be fixing this oversight in the next
update, so we'd like to warn you NOT to waste your money buying an object which will become useless
to you in the next update!

constantly protect their village from the dangers outside.
<p>

Our new improved customer support system is finally online. I've completely rewritten
the system to be easier and quicker to use. (and a lot more reliable!) If you've been having
trouble submitting support queries recently the new system should work properly for you.

The RuneScape database is now running from a faster server so everything should be a lot
more reliable now. I have also adjusted the network settings of the New-York servers so
hopefully they are a lot less laggy now. If you live in the US then you should try them out
again.

I went away for a short holiday on saturday, and it seems Runescape promptly broke
in my absence. It seems I can't even take 1 week a year away from running this game!
I'd like to apologise for the people who have experienced connections problems over the last
few days.  I've decided to abort the remainder of my holiday and have come back
to the office to fix RuneScape instead. 
<p>
I'm currently transfering the database to a new server which
is 6 times faster than the old one which should hopefully get things running smoothly again.
Once again sorry things weren't working 100%. Now I'm back at work I should be able to get
it working smoothly fairly quickly.

<b>Company History</b>

<p>In December 2001 Andrew Gower, Paul Gower and Constant Tedder got together and founded Jagex Limited as a commercial operation to take over the running of RuneScape, underlying technologies and other games developed by Andrew.  RuneScape had already by then become a game which had had over 1 million accounts created over 2001!  

<p>The three founders set out with two immediate tasks: firstly to make the operation of RuneScape commercially viable, establishing long term advertising sales relationships and secondly to develop a premium version of the game for subscription-paying members. 

<p>Both of these tasks were achieved soon after, and on 27th February 2002 Jagex launched RuneScape Members version.  In the first week after launch over 5000 people subscribed making RuneScape instantly one of the largest pay-to-play Java games in the world.

<p>Since that date RuneScape has gone from strength to strength: expanding as both a game - with regular updates giving new storylines, quests and maps produced by content development team and as an ever-growing community of sociable online game players.

<p><b>Future Development</b>

<p>Jagex has proprietary network communication and graphics compression technologies which are utilized in all its games. These technologies are continually evolving and form the backbone of our development plans.

<p>RuneScape itself will receive a major core technology upgrade around the beginning of 2003.  This upgrade will make RuneScape by far the most advanced Java game in the world and will enable the company to attack and achieve our ambitious targets.

<p><i>Jagex intends to become a significant operator in all the major gaming markets.  Developing and commercializing highly compelling persistent character games that appeal to a wide audience.  Our ambition for 2003 is to exceed 100,000 subscribers for RuneScape and begin work on our second game.</i>

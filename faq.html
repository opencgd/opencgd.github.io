<h3>Game License</h3>
Q: What can I do with a game I license?<br>
A: You can place the game or a customised version of it on one website which is owned
   and operated by you. You may only have one copy of the game online at any one time.
   If you wish to have multiple versions online, or use multiple websites then additional
   licenses must be purchased. You may not sub-license the game to other companies or
   websites.
<p>
Q: What is the installation procedure?<br>
A: Once the software is ready we will sent it to you as an email attachment to ensure
   you get it as quickly as possible. It will be provided with full detailed instructions
   on how to install it onto your server. The single-player games are very simple to
   install and just involve copying the files onto your server. Installing the
   multiplayer games is more complicated but should still be relatively easy for an 
   experienced network adminstrator.
<p>
Q: What support do you provide?<br>
A: After the software is installed we will provide 60 days of additional support.
   If you discover any problems with our software during this time which are caused
   by a fault in our software (i.e not an incompatibility problem) and can give us
   sufficient information to reproduce the problem we will fix it at no additional
   cost. In the event of us finding and correcting a problem ourselves or for another
   client, the fix will also be made available to you, even if beyond the inititial
   60 days.

<h4>Hosting</h4>
Q: What are the requirements to host a singleplayer game<br>
A: To host a singleplayer game you just need to place the files in a directory on your webserver.
The requirements are no more than that required to run a normal website.
<p>
Q: What are the hardware requirements to host a multiplayer game<br>
A: You need an x86 based machine (i.e both Intel Pentium, and AMD machines
will work) OR a sparc station. As a guide to the hardware requirements we
ourselves are running the games on cheap 733mhz linux boxes, and each
box can take up to 1000 simultaneous players.
<p>
Q: What are the connectivity requirements to host a multiplayer game<br>
A: The machine requires a good internet connection but no more than a
normal webserver. You will require sufficient access to install and run your
own software on the machine. (i.e. you need to be  able to telnet or SSH to
it and install software of your choice)
<p>
Q: What are the software requirements to host a multiplayer game<br>
A: The server should be running either Windows-NT, Sun-Solaris or Linux
as it's operating system. The server also requires the Sun-JAVA VM to be
installed. This is available for free, and the installation files for either
NT or Solaris can just be downloaded from Sun's website

<h4>Customisation</h4>
<p>
Q: Can you customise the game for me?<br>
A: Yes, we can make changes or additions to a game. Let us know what changes you require,
   and we will give you a quote for the additional cost depending on the complexity and
   how much code requires changing.
<p>
Q: Can you cobrand a game we license from you?<br>
A: Yes if you request it we will incorporate a logo you supply alongside ours on the loading
   screen, and will also place it on the title screen. There is no extra charge for this. 
<p>
Q: I have a great idea for a game, or want a specific game for my site. Can you write it for me?<br>
A: Yes, we can develop your game idea. The game can be designed to your specifications,
   or we can help design it for you. If you send us your exact requirements, we will give you a
   quote for us to develop your game.
<p>
Q: Can I contract you to program the game, but supply my own graphics?<br>
A: Yes, we can do this and offer a 10-20% discount if the graphics are supplied. We will work
   with you to determine what sizes and graphics we require to program your game. We will begin
   programming the game once all the graphics are supplied.
<p>
Q: Can I integrate your games with my existing registration system?<br>
A: Yes this is possible, to facilitate integration with a customers own login system
our multiplayer games applet can accept the username and password as external
parameters, which are then used to automatically log-in to the server.

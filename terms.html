<b>Terms and conditions</b>
<p>
runescape.com, jagex.com, the RuneScape game, and all other games contained on this website,
are operated and maintained by Jagex Limited.
<p>
By using our website or any related service you are agreeing to the terms and conditions below. If you do not agree then you must leave this website immediately.
<p>
If you are under the age of 18 then you must NOT use our services without first asking your parent(s)/guardian(s) for permission. Your parent(s)/guardian(s) must read and agree to these terms+conditions on your behalf before you may use our website or game.
<p>
<b>RuneScape accounts</b>
<p>
It is your responsibility to ensure that your RuneScape password remains safe. You must not disclose your password to anybody else for any reason. Real Jagex staff will never ask you for your current password. You must ensure your computer is kept free of viruses and trojans to ensure the safety of your password.
<p>
You agree that your character and account in RuneScape, is the property of, and remains the property of Jagex. You may not sell, transfer, or lend your account to anyone else. You may not accept an account which somebody else offers you.
<p>
You may create more than one RuneScape account, but if you do, you may not log in more than one account at any time, and they must not interact with each other in any way. Using one account to drop objects for transfer to another of your accounts is not allowed.
<p>
<b>Chat-facility</b>
<p>
When using the RuneScape chat-facility you must not use any language which may be considered by others to be offensive, racist or obscene. You must not use the chat facility to harass, threaten, scam or deceive other players.
<p>
You agree that the chat facility is ONLY for role-playing in the game, and is not designed or intended to be used as a forum for other types of discussion.
<p>
You agree that for the purpose of preventing offensive language and cheating we may automatically or manually censor the chat as we see fit, and that we may record or monitor the chat to help us identify offenders.
<p>
Sexually-harassing, threatening, stalking, or otherwise harassing others is illegal, and may result in legal action being taken against you.
<p>
If you are a victim of the sort of behavior described above, or receive any other unwanted communications you must use the built in facilities to block the messages. If there is a particular user causing a problem then use the ignore function to block further messages. (to do this point at the friends menu, click on the 'ignore' tab, click where it says 'click here to add a name' and finally enter the name of the user to block.) If you continue to receive unwanted messages, or receive harassment from multiple players then you must use the privacy controls to block all messages from everyone except your friends. (to do this point at the configuration menu, and ensure all 4 privacy settings are switched to 'on'). If you continue to have problems, or are still not satisfied then you must immediately stop playing RuneScape and must no longer access this website.
<p>
<b>Cheating</b>
<p>
You must not exploit any cheats or errors which you find in our multiplayer software. Any exploits which you find must be immediately reported to Jagex.
<p>
You must not attempt to use other programs in conjunction with our games to give yourself an unfair advantage at the game. You may not use any bots or macros to control your character for you. When you are not playing the game you must log-out. You may not circumvent any of our mechanisms designed to log out inactive users automatically.
<p>
You must not reverse-engineer, decompile or modify the runescape client in any way. Using a modified/customised version of the runescape client is cheating and will result in a ban or stat-wipe.
<p>
Violation of these terms and conditions may be cause for deletion of all your accounts, the blocking of your access to our services, and/or further legal action. We may delete or modify any account at any time for any reason.
<p>
<b>Warning/Disclaimer</b>
<p>

You acknowledge that it is unpractical for us to control and monitor everything that users do in our game, and that we therefore cannot be held responsible for any abusive or inappropriate content which appears on our site as a result.

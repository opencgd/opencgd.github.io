<b>Online games</b>
<p>
<u>Single Player Games</u><br>

There are two versions of RuneScape, a Free Version which requires no subscription but does require you to choose a Username and a Password to access and play, and a Members Version which is Subscription-based.  Your use of RuneScape is also subject to our <a href="rules.html">Rules of Conduct.</a>
<p>
<b>Your responsibilities</b>
<p>
<u>Username</u><br>
You must not choose a Username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff of other users, or which is deliberately confusing or which is offensive, racist, obscene or otherwise unlawful.  We reserve the right to change any Username for any reason.
<p>
<u>Password</u><br>
You agree to keep your Password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person.  You must ensure that your computer is kept free of viruses and Trojans to ensure the safety of your password.  Real Jagex staff will never ask you for your current password.

<p>
You may create more than one RuneScape account, but if you do, you may not log into more than one account at any time, and they must not interact with each other in any way.  Using one account to drop objects for transfer to another of your accounts is not allowed.
<p>
We reserve the right to delete all your accounts, block your access to our website and services, and/or take further legal action if you violate any of these terms and conditions. We may delete or modify any account at any time for any reason.

<p>
If you are the victim of the sort of behaviour described above, or receive any other unwanted communications you must use the built in facilities to block the messages.  If there is a particular user causing a problem then use the ignore function to block further messages (to do this point at the friends menu, click on the 'ignore' tab, click where it says 'click here to add a name' and enter the name of the user to block).  If you continue to receive unwanted messages, or receive harassment from multiple players you must use the privacy controls to block all messages from everyone except your friends (to do this point at the configuration menu, and ensure all four privacy settings are switched to 'on').  If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied then you must stop using this web site.

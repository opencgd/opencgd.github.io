<center><b>Initiating combat</b></center><p>
To fight a monster or character in the game just point your mouse at your opponent and select the 'attack' option. Not
ever character in the game can be attacked, so if no attack option is visible on the menu, then the
character is probably part of some quest or shop, and is not designed to be fought.
<p>
<table><tr><td><img src=combat1.gif width=283 height=193></td><td>
When you point the mouse at your opponent their relative strength will be indicated next to their name. In the example here
the rat can be seen to be a level-8 monster. This is also coloured coded to help you decide if you should fight or not.
It your opponent is weaker than you the indicator is shown in green, for equal opponents it is shown in yellow, wheras for stronger
opponents it is shown in red.
</td></tr></table>
<p>
Be wary about attacking monsters which are marked as much stronger than you. You could easily die before you get a chance to
retreat. Some of the more aggresive monsters - particularly ones which dwell further away from the cities, or in the dungeon, will
attack you if you just move near to them so be careful where you go to start with!
<p>
<center><b>During the fight</b></center><p>
<table><tr><td>
Once you are fighting a monster an indicator will be displayed at the top left of the screen which you can
use to select your combat style. Choosing 'accurate' will make you more likely to hit your opponent. Choosing 'aggressive' means
that when you do hit your opponent you are likely to do more damage. 'defensive' makes your opponent less likely to hit you. Wheras 
'controlled' simply improves all three by a smaller amount. The combat style you select also affects which stats
you gain experience points in when you kill the monster.
</td><td><img src=combat2.gif width=197 height=138></td></tr></table>
<p>
<table><tr><td><img src=combat3.gif width=217 height=169></td><td>
The strength of each combat participent is indicate by a horizontal bar above their head. If your bar is entirely green you are not
hurt, it will turn red as you are hit. If the bar goes entirely red your character will die.
A numbers will also briefly appear over you whenever you are hit by your oppoenent,
indicating how many points of damage you just sustained.
</td></tr></table>
<p>
If you find you are losing the battle, then you can run away by clicking on the ground. You can't run away during the first few
seconds of combat, but after that you are free to retreat. If you do retreat it's best to
keep moving until you are some distance from your opponent as they may well pursue you.
<p>
<center><b>Dieing</b></center><p>
Dieing isn't much fun, so we recommend you avoid it. However most players will sooner or
later get into a fight they can't win and end up losing all their hitpoints. Luckily death
in RuneScape isn't permanent and after a few moments you will reappear in Lumbridge.
<p>
You keep all your stats and skills, BUT you drop the items you are carrying!
It is unlikely you will be able to retrieve them so we recommend you keep as
many of your valuables in the bank as possible.
If you haven't attacked any other players recently (see section on player killing) you will
also keep your 3 most valuable items. But you won't keep stackable items like coins, runes, arrows,
etc...

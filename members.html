<h3>RuneScape members</h3>
If you enjoy playing RuneScape then why not support further RuneScape development
by becoming a RuneScape member? As a member you will get access to a whole load of additional
members-only benefits and features.
<p>
Upgrading your chracter to member status costs just $5/month. To sign-up
or find out about the different payment options, just <a href="signup.html">Click here!</a>
<p>
<b>No-risk!</b> If after trying members RuneScape you decide it's not for you, you can simply switch
back to freeplay RuneScape, and no further charges will be made.
Of course if you do this any members-only items or skills will be disabled,
but they will NOT be removed. This means if you subsequently decide to resume your membership the
members items and skills you gained before will start working again.

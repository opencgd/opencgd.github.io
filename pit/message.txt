="THE BOTTOMLESS PIT!";
="THE BOTTOMLESS PIT!";
="You are now falling down a genuine bottomless pit";
="It's a long way to the bottom";
="Because it's bottomless";
="In fact jumping down a bottomless pit is a BAD idea";
="A VERY BAD idea!";
="There's no way out now";
="You're falling";
="down and down and down";
="further and further";
="at least you're not going to land on anything hard";
="because you won't land";
="did I mention that this is a BOTTOMLESS pit?";
="still falling";
="it's getting pretty boring isn't it?";
="you'd better get used to it, you have an ETERNITY after all...";
="Mu-hahahahaha";
="This pit took a long time to dig";
="But it was worth the effort";
="Let this be a lesson to you.";
="You should never jump down strange pits";
="You're still falling";
="It is a proven fact that jumping down pits is bad for you";
="bottomless pits, doubly so.";
="You are falling";
="You will continue falling!";
="Mu-hahahahaha";
="[evil laughter]";
="You are STILL falling";
="when I said this pit was bottomless";
="I wasn't lieing";
="Deeper and deeper and deeper";
="Down and down";
="I'll let you know how to earn free-money, no catches";
="as soon as you reach the bottom of this pit";
="does that sound fair?";	
="Has the sound driven you mad yet?";
="Every pit should have a genuine continuely falling sound";
="I daresay this pit is very good for annoying your neighbours!!";
="I hope you have the volume nice and loud";
="by the way you are still falling";
="it's a very repetative pit isn't it?";
="you have to bear in mind that by now you are falling very fast";
="so you can't see much detail anyway";
="I daresay you've reached terminal velocity anyway";
="Are you still reading this?";
="Wow!!";
="Well done!";
="You must really like bottomless pits";
="I bet you get bored eventually though";
="after a few years maybe";
="by which time you will have gone totally insane!";
="Hmm still no sign of the bottom";
="Perhaps if you wait just a little big longer...";
="After all a bottomless pit would be impossible!";
="Or would it?";
="The only way to find out would be to wait forever";
="And I doubt you have that much time spare";
="In case you haven't noticed";
="You are still falling!";
="and just to make things more interesting";
="you are spinning as well";
="After all, I wouldn't want this pit to get boring";
="That would be just terrible!";
="Since you have waited this long...";
="Here are some cheat codes";
="For various JAGeX games";
="Outpost 31: Press * for lots of lives";
="Outpost 31: Hold / for more speed";
="Goldmine: Press * to skip levels";
="Meteoroids: Press shift+[ for invincibility";
="Meteoroids: Press shift+] to skip levels";
="Meltdown: Press shift+[ for lots of lives";
="Meltdown: Press shift+] for more speed";
="Using a cheat disqualifies you from the hiscore table";
="None of the other games have cheats";
="And giving password lists here would take far too long";
="You haven't stopped falling yet";
="Perhaps this pit is bottomless after all!";
="Could this message be bottomless as well?";
="You do realise that";
="the longer you fall down this pit";
="The harder it will be to climb back up!";
="It has been pointed out to me that";
="This pit can get pretty hypnotising!";
="Some people just can't stop falling";
="For your own safety you should stop now!";
="There's really nothing more interesting to see";
="Here is an email I receieved, which";
="attempts to explain this pit:";
="A bottomless pit is really bottomless";
="But it isn't nothing";
="What is nothing?";
="Nothing can't be something";
="Because something is anything not nothing";
="But nothing must be something";
="Or else it wouldn't be anything";
="Even though we call it nothing";
=". . .";
="Well I think I'm even more confused than before";
="And I was pretty confused to start with";
="Have you noticed that this pit";
="is getting quite warm now?";
="Perhaps you are approaching the centre";
="of the earth!";
="But if that happened you would stop falling";
="And whilst the pit would still be bottomless";
="You wouldn't keep falling for ever";
="Like I originally promised";
="I can see this could be a slight problem";
="Luckily this is a 'magic' pit";
="Perhaps you are just getting hot";
="Due to air friction";
="Stands to reason really";
="You are still whizzing down the bottomless pit";
="Falling down towards certain...";
="Well falling down anyway";
="If you ever reach the bottom";
="Be sure to let me know!";
="Oh, I forgot, it's bottomless...";
="Well even though the pit is bottomless";
="This message isn't";
="So it's starting again now...";
